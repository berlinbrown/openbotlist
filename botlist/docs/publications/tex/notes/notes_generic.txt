Spring is not normally known for the view piece but for simplifying
the architecture.  The basic Spring MVC view library was used.

Use of entity beans.

The data access may be implemenated via a single or multiple database
accesses.  Hibernate used to access a single data source

Java Language:

Language Spec: 
Good, generic description of the java programming languages.
Every variable has a type at compile time.
two categories: primitive types and reference types.

Scalable architectures, maintable, etc.
------------------------

The Java programming language is a strongly typed language, 
which means that every variable and every expression has a 
type that is known at compile time.

It includes automatic storage management, typically using a 
garbage collector, to avoid the safety problems of explicit 
deallocation (as in C's free or C++'s delete).

The Java programming language is strongly typed. This specification 
clearly distinguishes between the compile-time errors that can 
and must be detected at compile time, and those that occur at run time. 

The Java programming language is a general-purpose, concurrent, 
class-based, object-oriented language.

The Java programming language is normally compiled to 
the bytecoded instruction set and binary format defined 
in The Java Virtual Machine Specification, Second Edition
